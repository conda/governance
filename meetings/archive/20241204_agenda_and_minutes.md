## New Agenda Items

- [x] JRG: Low engagement in https://conda.zulipchat.com. Join us! :)
- [x] JRG/JL: Github App / bot for votes: https://github.com/conda/governance/issues/195.
- [x] WV: shell completion scripts
    - Would like to implement something similar to Homebrew's standardized location for shell completion scripts
    - https://github.com/prefix-dev/pixi/issues/2366
    - CHL: as a meta-question, should we write something similar to the [Linux Filesystem Hierarchy Standard](https://refspecs.linuxfoundation.org/FHS_3.0/fhs/index.html) for the conda ecosystem?
        - Generally, sure. But Windows...
        - But writing this/these standard(s) should not block any on-going/new work. This exercise is mostly a backfill.
