## Introductions

- [ ]

## Announcements

- [ ] (JL: most Anaconda staff are at a company meeting during the meeting this week and won't be able to attend)
- [ ] JRG: CEP vote for `environment.yml` until Apr 21: https://github.com/conda/ceps/pull/81

## New Agenda Items

- [ ] (JK) Sub-team structure
    - https://github.com/conda/governance/issues/222
    - https://github.com/conda/governance/issues/225
    - https://github.com/conda/governance/issues/226
    - MRB: The original intent of the subteams section in the governance was _not_ to tie every Github team to a governance-defined subteam.
    - JRG: Add note about that in the governance?
    - MRB: If the intent is just to provision access to project boards, suggest to create per-project-board / per-contract teams without going through a vote.
    - TA: Add badges / repo tags to each repo to list them as community or federated.
